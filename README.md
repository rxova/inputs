---

Complex inputs deserve careful handling of formatting, interaction, accessibility and forms. Rxova
React Inputs brings those details together in focused components, helping you create a polished
experience while keeping control of markup and styling.

Every component follows the same principles: platform semantics, native form submission, a small
typed API and **no stylesheet to import**. The result is a suite that works with your design system
and gives you more time to focus on the experience you want to build.

## The suite

| Package                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | What it does                                                                    | Brotli    |

## Installation

Install the whole suite from one package:

```bash
npm install @rxova/react-inputs
```

Or add only the components you use:

```bash
npm install @rxova/react-otp-input
```

The two are equivalent — the meta-package re-exports each component, and `sideEffects: false`
means your bundler drops whatever you don't import.

## Usage

```ts
import { CurrencyInput, Rating, OtpInput } from '@rxova/react-inputs'
// or
import { OtpInput } from '@rxova/react-otp-input'
```

Requires React 18 or 19. React is the shared peer dependency; the currency package also lists React
DOM as a peer. Each package includes dual ESM/CJS builds with types for both and is published with
npm provenance.

## Quick start

Components from Rxova React Inputs use controlled values: provide a value and a change handler, and
they fit naturally alongside your other form fields.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react'
import { CurrencyInput, Rating, OtpInput } from '@rxova/react-inputs'

function Checkout() {
  const [price, setPrice] = useState<number | null>(null)
  const [score, setScore] = useState(0)
  const [code, setCode] = useState('')

  return (
    <>
      <CurrencyInput locale="en-US" currency="USD" value={price} onValueChange={setPrice} />
      <Rating value={score} onChange={setScore} precision={0.5} label="Rate your meal" />
      <OtpInput length={6} value={code} onChange={setCode} label="One-time code" />
    </>
  )
}
```

Each change handler receives the component's plain value rather than a synthetic event. Add `name`
when you want the value to submit natively from a plain `<form>`.

## Why Rxova React Inputs

- **Headless.** No stylesheet to import. Only layout-critical CSS is inlined; everything visual is
  a CSS custom property or a `data-*` hook, and those selectors are covered by semver.
- **Accessible by construction.** Native radios in a `radiogroup`, a single underlying `<input>`
  behind the OTP slots, and `role="img"` when read-only. Keyboard navigation, focus-visible, RTL and
  `prefers-reduced-motion` come from the platform, and every build is checked with
  `@axe-core/playwright`.
- **Lightweight.** There are no bundled runtime dependencies. React is a peer, and the currency
  package also peers React DOM. Each package carries a `size-limit` budget enforced on every pull
  request.
- **Designed for important details.** Locale-specific grouping, native digits, formatted paste,
  browser translation, IME, RTL and SSR/RSC are covered as part of the supported experience.
- **Typed, tested, documented.** TypeScript strict, 95% per-file coverage thresholds, unit plus
  browser plus Playwright E2E suites, and an API reference generated from source by TypeDoc so it
  stays aligned with the code.
