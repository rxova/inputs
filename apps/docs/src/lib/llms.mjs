// The llms.txt pair: https://llmstxt.org
//
// `llms.txt` is an index — headings and links, small enough that fetching it
// costs nothing and an agent can decide what else to read. `llms-full.txt` is
// every page inlined, for the case where one fetch should be the whole thing.
//
// Both are built from `docsPages()`, the same enumeration the `.md` twins use, so
// the three surfaces cannot disagree about what pages exist. Everything here is
// pure — the endpoints in src/pages are three-line adapters — because the shape
// of these documents is the part worth testing, and it needs no Astro to check.
