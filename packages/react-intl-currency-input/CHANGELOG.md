# @rxova/react-intl-currency-input

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- [#13](https://github.com/rxova/react-inputs/pull/13) [`efc7bba`](https://github.com/rxova/react-inputs/commit/efc7bba37136fc1ec7e4dd5af0070870bc0d29ba) - Point the README and `homepage` at the routes the docs site actually serves.
  The Docusaurus-era `/packages/react-inputs/currency` landing route and the shared
  `/guides/*` pages were removed when the docs were restructured per component,
  so every documentation link on the npm page 404'd.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- [`52a71be`](https://github.com/rxova/react-inputs/commit/52a71be1cacad59dafff8b3951cbc15bf4b2fd88) - Add the currency input package logo and refresh the Rxova React Inputs documentation.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [`f5dd58c`](https://github.com/rxova/react-inputs/commit/f5dd58c91d6aeef8cb7aa83d51e21a55f91326f9) Correct the published README and package metadata after the move into the rxova monorepo.

  The README shown on npm is served from the published tarball, so these fixes required a release:

  - **Install commands and imports named the pre-migration packages.** The READMEs told users to
    install `react-feedback-stars`, `react-otp-slots` and `react-intl-currency-input`, and imported
    from those specifiers, none of which are the published names. They now use the `@rxova/*` names.
  - **Documentation links were dead.** Every `rxova.github.io/react-*` link, plus the `/recipes/*` and
    `/playground` routes, returned 404. They now point at the live docs on
    `rxova.org/packages/react-inputs`.
  - **CI badges pointed at the pre-migration repositories**, so they showed either a 404 image or the
    status of an archived repo. They now report this repository's CI.
  - **`homepage` in each manifest pointed at `rxova.github.io/react-inputs/…`**, which is not served —
    this is the "Homepage" link on the npm page. It now points at the live docs.
  - Added npm version badges, and documented each package's place in the suite.

  No runtime code changed in these packages; `dist` output is identical.
