/**
 * `@rxova/react-inputs` is the "whole suite from one install" package. Its
 * dependency list and its re-exports cannot be discovered at runtime — npm
 * needs the dependency declared, and a static `export *` is what makes the
 * types and tree-shaking work — so they are the two lists that must be written
 * by hand and therefore the two that go stale.
 *
 * Both fail quietly. A component missing from `dependencies` still builds
 * locally, because pnpm hoists it in the workspace; it breaks only for someone
 * installing from npm. A component missing from index.ts imports fine from its
 * own package and is simply absent from the meta-package. Neither shows up in a
 * build, a type-check or any component's own suite.
